# Lesson-0.1

## How a computer sees the world

Take a look around yourself. Try and describe your surroundings. Your description could something like this:

```
There is a table in front of me.
My hp laptop is on the table.
The fan above me is turned on.
There is a purple bottle on the table
```

You can make this description because you have an intuitive understanding of what things like *bottle*, *table* and *laptop* are.
